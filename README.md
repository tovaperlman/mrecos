### Hi there 👋
My name is Matt and I write code to build tools and analysis that (hopefully) help others. I do this for work at a large engineering infrastructure company (AECOM), for students as an instructor in the PENN MUSA program, for NPOs at Mica Data Labs and along with UrbanSpatial, and for fun (when time allows).
