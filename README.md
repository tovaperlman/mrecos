### Hi there 👋
My name is Matt and I write code to build tools and analysis that (hopefully) help others. I do this for work at a large engineering infrastructure company (AECOM), for students as an instructor in the PENN MUSA program, for NPOs at Mica Data Labs and along with UrbanSpatial, and for fun (when time allows). 

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on CV19 related shiny apps, common data platforms, and the occasional ML pipeline. (mostly private repos)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning shiny, sihny modules, and how much I don't know about JS
- 💬 Ask me about R or using Data Science in the Engineering & Construction Industry
- 📫 How to reach me: matthew.d.harris@aecom.com or md_harris on Twitter
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him, they/them
